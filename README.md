# Data-Duplication-Removal-using-Checksum-Project
Final Year Projects as Deletion of Duplicated files so to Increase the space of system. Process will be done through checksum. 

## Some Points:

-	Detecting and removing duplicates using Machine Learning by calculating the digest of files which takes less time than other pre-implemented methods. 

-	The project proposes an efficient method for detecting and removing duplicates using machine learning algorithms.

-	Storage optimization by de-duplication.

-	We read the file with duplicate data and store all the unique entries in it in another new file.

-	The input dataset consists of a lot of duplicate entries.

- The goal of this Project is to use a machine learning approach to remove those duplicate entries.
